      nextDialogueId: 
  - message: I fled a kingdom like yours. Lived under the rule of a man who claimed
      to be just, claimed to be wise. But kings only rule for themselves. Power always
      curdles into tyranny.

  - message: "But\u2026 I know things. I know how the common folk fight, how we survive.
      If your soldiers fought like us\u2014if they learned to stand together instead
      of bowing to a throne\u2014maybe they\u2019d be something more than pawns in
      your little game."
    options:
    - optionText: If you know so much of war, then prove it. Join us and fight for
        something greater than yourself, as an equal.

    - optionText: If you possess such wisdom, then share it. Teach my army your ways,
        so they can fight not as soldiers, but as survivors, and free themselves
        from my reign of terror.

  - message: "Knowledge isn\u2019t free. If you want my teachings, you\u2019ll have
      to give up one of your royal decrees. A King's Order\u2014one less command
      from a throne, one less chain around the world\u2019s neck."
